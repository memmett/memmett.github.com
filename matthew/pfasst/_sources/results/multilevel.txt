Multilevel PFASST
=================

PyPFASST now supports multiple levels of space/time discretisations.
For multi-level runs the levels are traversed in a V-cycle order.  For
example, during one iteration of a 3-level PFASST run, SDC sweeps are
performed on the levels in the following order: 0, 1, 2, 1; and the
solution is propagated to the next processor after the sweep on the
finest level (level 0).  This is pictured in Figure 1.

Three level viscous Burger's
----------------------------

As in :doc:`coarse_sweeps`, we consider the viscous Burger's equation

.. math::

   u_t + u \nabla u = \nu \nabla^2 u.
